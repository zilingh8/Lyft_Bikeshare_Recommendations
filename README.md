# San Francisco_Bikeshare_Recommendations

In this school project, I explore a large public dataset on GoogleCloud Platform on Lyft's San Francisco Bikeshare Trips. I analyze and query the data using BigQuery and provide visualizations (pyplot, geopandas) and recommendations to the management on how to increase ridership.

You will find the details in 3 files below : 

   1. bikeshare_p1_p2.md : This contains queries using GoogleBigQuery GUI Interface and the CLI.
   
   2. bikeshare_p3.ipynb : This contains the report and an appendix showing all code for SQL queries used in data exploration. 
   
   3. bart csv : This contains the coordinates for BART stations in San Francisco
